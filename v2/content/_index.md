I'm a software developer from Melbourne, Australia. I like warm weather
{{ quiet(text="🏝️") }} and tinkering with computers; ranging from small
microcontrollers, up to large servers and the operating systems that run upon
them. I'm a [Rustacean] {{ quiet(text="🦀") }} with a fondness for mechanical
keyboards and I work at [YesLogic] on the [Prince] HTML to PDF converter.
