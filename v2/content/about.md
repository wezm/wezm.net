Hi, I'm Wes (he/him). I'm a software developer originally from Melbourne,
Australia. I now live on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland. I like open-source
software and warm weather. I enjoy tinkering with computers, ranging from small
microcontrollers up to large servers and the operating systems that run upon
them. I like to take photos around my home and places I visit. The better ones
end up on [Flickr].

[Arch Linux] is my primary desktop operating system, with the [COSMIC] desktop.
However, I have migrated to [Chimera Linux] on my laptop and plan to eventually
do the same on my desktop. I detailed my desktop computing stack in more detail
in the post [Tech Stack 2024](@/posts/2024/tech-stack/index.md).

The server hosting this website runs [Alpine Linux] and is hosted by
[Vultr]<sup>(affiliate link)</sup>. I've written more about my personal server
infrastructure in
[Rebuilding My Personal Infrastructure With Alpine Linux and Docker][my server].

This site is built with the [Zola] static site compiler and [the source
code][src] is published on GitHub. I have some other websites as well: you can
read more about my operating system adventures on [bitcannon.net]. I maintain a
custom-built link blog at [linkedlist.org](https://linkedlist.org/). Finally, I
have a retro-themed website hosted at home on a LattePanda single board
computer. It's a lot of fun to work on and is an ode to late 90s and early
2000s websites and the computers we used to make
them:<br><http://home.wezm.net/~wmoore/>.

I prefer typing on mechanical keyboards. I have a small collection in a range
of sizes. Almost all are fully programmable. My current favourite is a [WK870]
with Gateron G Pro 2.0 brown switches. This keyboard is not programmable, so I
use [keyd] to do low-level key-mapping on Linux. You can see
[my configuration][keyd.conf] in my [dotfiles repo][dotfiles].

[Rust] is my preferred programming language. I am fairly active in the Rust
community and used to curate [Read Rust], a website that collected interesting
posts about Rust.
