I'm a software developer originally from Melbourne, Australia. I now live on
the Sunshine Coast in Queensland. I like open-source software and warm weather.
I enjoy tinkering with computers, ranging from small microcontrollers up to
large servers and the operating systems that run upon them.

[Arch Linux] is my desktop operating system of choice, with the [Awesome] window
manager. The [server hosting this website][my server] runs [Alpine Linux]. You
can read more about my OS adventures on [bitcannon.net].

I prefer typing on mechanical keyboards. I have a small collection in a range of
sizes. All are fully programmable. My current favourite is a Filco Majestouch
Ninja 2, which has had the factory controller replaced with a programmable one.

[Rust] is my favourite programming language. I am fairly active in the Rust
community and curate [Read Rust], a website that collects interesting posts
from the Rust community.

I am fine with either he/him or they/them pronouns.
