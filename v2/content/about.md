I'm a software developer originally from Melbourne, Australia. I now live on
the Sunshine Coast in Queensland. I like open-source software and warm weather.
I enjoy tinkering with computers, ranging from small microcontrollers up to
large servers and the operating systems that run upon them.

[Arch Linux] is my primary desktop operating system, with the [Awesome] window
manager. However, I have migrated to [Chimera Linux] on my laptop and plan to
eventually do the same on my desktop. The [server hosting this website][my
server] runs [Alpine Linux] and is hosted by [Vultr]<sup>(affiliate link)</sup>.
You can read more about my OS adventures on [bitcannon.net].

I prefer typing on mechanical keyboards. I have a small collection in a range
of sizes. Almost all are fully programmable. My current favourite is a [WK870] with
Gateron G Pro 2.0 brown switches, which has had the factory controller replaced
with a programmable one.

[Rust] is my preferred programming language. I am fairly active in the Rust
community and used to curate [Read Rust], a website that collects interesting
posts from the Rust community.

I am fine with either he/him or they/them pronouns.
