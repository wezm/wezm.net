The [Read Rust Twitter account][read_rust] crossed over 10K followers in the
last few days. Amazingly 4350 of those coming after I stopped regular posting.
This got me thinking about the account and how I might be able
to use it to benefit the community while avoiding the overhead that led me to
[winding things down in Sep 2020](@/posts/2020/slowing-read-rust-posting.md).

Since then the @rustlang Twitter account has become much less active, so
perhaps there is room for the Read Rust Twitter account as well. My plan is to
resume using @read_rust, but I will not be seeking out content to post like I
did previously. I'll retweet interesting things that I come across during my
usual reading and will _consider_ sharing posts that mention @read_rust.
Hopefully that represents a sustainable time commitment.

Onwards! ðŸ¦€
