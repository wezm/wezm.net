A few weeks ago I got up at 2:30am and attended virtual [RustConf
2021][RustConf]. The pre-recorded talks were live-streamed and there was a
dedicated Discord server for discussion and Q&A while the talks ran. It was
overall well organised and a good experience. All the talks were interesting
and well executed.  The Discord chat was fun but I'm not sure it added a lot to
the _value_ of my experience.

I think if you had a talk that you were particularly interested in, being
present for the conference and having direct access to the speaker might be
valuable. Alternatively it seemed that for folks newer to the language the chat
provided easy access to a lot of people to answer questions and provide
explanations. With this in mind, in the future I think I'll probably stick to
watching the videos after they're posted to YouTube (and not mess with my
sleep). Having said that, they plan to return to an in-person conference (in
Portland) next year.

My favourites were:

- [Deadlocked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnYQKWs_7EA&list=PL85XCvVPmGQgACNMZlhlRZ4zlKZG_iWH5&index=2) by Mara Bos
- [The Importance of Not Over-Optimizing in Rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CV5CjUlcqsw&list=PL85XCvVPmGQgACNMZlhlRZ4zlKZG_iWH5&index=4) by Lily Mara
- [Identifying Pokémon Cards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLy_YF4nmqQ&list=PL85XCvVPmGQgACNMZlhlRZ4zlKZG_iWH5&index=5) by Hugo Peixoto
- [Hacking rustc: Contributing to the Compiler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9H9SO2u6Q20&list=PL85XCvVPmGQgACNMZlhlRZ4zlKZG_iWH5&index=12) by Esteban Kuber

You can watch all the talks in the [RustConf 2021 playlist on YouTube][playlist].

The best thing about Esteban's talk may have been this exchange on Discord:
