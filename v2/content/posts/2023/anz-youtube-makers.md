I decided I wanted to add some more local folks into my YouTube subscriptions.
I [put the call out on Mastodon][toot] for suggestions for folks doing videos
about machining, woodworking, electronics, software, that type of thing. I
received a number of helpful replies and thought it might be useful to collect
the list (as well as ones I'm already subscribed to) on this page in case
others are looking for new channels to check out.
