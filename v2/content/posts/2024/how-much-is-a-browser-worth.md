Apparently people are excited about funding independent browser efforts this
week. I have little interest in funding yet another browser built in C++ in
2024 but [Servo] is still alive. Since Mozilla refuse to let us directly
fund Firefox I shall set up a recurring donation to Servo.

The next question is how much is a web browser worth to me? Based on minutes
spent using a browser, quite a lot!

<!-- more -->

Once upon a time you could pay for Netscape. It seems that [in 1996 Netscape
3.0 cost US$49][netscape3]. Adjusting for inflation that's US$97 in 2024. Let's
round that up to an even US$100. At the time of writing [Numbat] tells me
that's AU$150 or AU$12.50 per month, which seems reasonable.

Some other services for comparison (I don't actually have an active YouTube
Premium subscription):

- Netflix: AU$18.99/m
- YouTube Premium: AU$16.99/m
- JetBrains Rust Rover: US$129/y (AU$194, AU$16/m)

A browser is a least as useful as these, almost certainly more. So, I've set up
a US$15/m (AU$22.50) recurring sponsorship on GitHub. I encourage you to [do
the same][sponsor-servo].
