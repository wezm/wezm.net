I don't have time to build all the things I'd like to build, so I'm offering
bounties on the following work.

<!-- more -->

**Details**

* Payment will be made via PayPal when the criteria is met. If you would prefer
  another mechanism, feel free to suggest it, but no guarantees.
* Amounts are in Australian dollars.
* I will not pay out a bounty after the expiration date.
* I may choose to extend the expiration date.
* _How can I trust you'll pay me?_ I like to think that I'm a trustworthy
  person. However, if you would like to discuss a partial payment prior
  to starting work please get in touch.
* You have to be the primary contributor to claim the bounty. If someone else
  does all the work and you just nudge it over the line the other person is
  the intended recipient.
* If in doubt contact me.
