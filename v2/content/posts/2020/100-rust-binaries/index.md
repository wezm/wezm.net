I recently completed a [#100binaries] series on Twitter wherein I shared one
open-source [Rust] tool or application each day, for one hundred days (Jul—Nov
2020). This post lists binaries 1–50.
[See page 2 for binaries 51–100](@/posts/2020/100-rust-binaries/page2.md).

All images and videos without an explicit source were created by me for the
series. Most picture the [Alacritty] terminal emulator running on Linux. I use
the [PragmataPro font][PragmataPro] and my prompt is generated by
[vim-promptline]. The colour scheme is [Base16 Default Dark][base16].

I also wrote a follow-up post about how this page was built and the
considerations that went into making it as lightweight as possible:
