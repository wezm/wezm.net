It's been more than 10 years since I started working on [the previous design]
for this website ðŸ˜…, although it won't have been public for 10 years until July
2020. This feels like a good point to come up with a one!

The previous design served me well. The uncluttered design focussed on text was
fast and responsive. It saw the introduction of new devices like iPad and a
gradual increase in mobile display size without needing updating. The new
design aims to retain these features while giving it a lighter feel. I'm using
the [Manrope] variable font for all text.

Technology wise, the previous site was built with [Nanoc], a Ruby static site
compiler. I've been very happy with Nanoc. As my programming interests have
shifted away from Ruby to Rust in the last decade I wanted to try a Rust static
site compiler. The site is now built with [Zola]. Zola is perhaps not quite as
flexible as Nanoc but I've been able to achieve everything I wanted to with it.
It's super fast and has nice conveniences like live-reload when editing
content. Being a single file native binary also makes installation
straightforward â€” no need to juggle Ruby versions or install gems.

Inspired by [Chris Krycho] and [Shaun Inman] I've taken to versioning the
website instead of attempting to port all the existing content over to the new
technology.  This makes the redesign more of a clean slate and leaves old posts
appearing how the did when originally posted. The new site is hosted under the
`/v2/` prefix.  This allows all existing pages to stay where they are and
retains the `www.wezm.net` domain.

Finally, I've now open sourced [the repository][repo] that the site is generated from. This
is to allow others to see how the site is built and also to submit corrections/fixes
if they're noticed.
