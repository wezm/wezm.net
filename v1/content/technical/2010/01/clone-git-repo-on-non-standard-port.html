I use an SSH tunnel to access my computer at work from home. On occasion I want
to clone a git repo that is on the remote server. To do so it's necessary to
specify the port, which doesn't work with the conventional clone syntax.

E.g. `git clone hostname:path/to/repo`. The solution is to be a little more
specific:

    git clone ssh://localhost:2222/~username/path/to/repo
