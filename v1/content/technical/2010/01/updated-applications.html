Over a year ago in <a href="/technical/2008/09/update-expectations/">Update Expectations</a> I noted three Mac applications that I had bought, which had seen little or no attention since their release. Today I noticed that one of these apps had seen a major new release. The application in question is AppZapper. The <a href="http://osx.iusethis.com/app/versions/199">changelog on i use this</a> notes the following:

* Free for all 1.x customers!
* Completely rewritten from the ground up for Snow Leopard
* Faster, smarter, easier to use zapping
* New 'Hit List' feature lets you browse and filter all of your apps
* New 'My Apps' feature lets you store license info for purchased applications
* Many overall improvements

This is great news. Although it would have been nice to see some evidence the application was still alive in the 3 years between updates.

Also worth noting is another app that I mentioned in the original post, <a href="http://xtorrentp2p.com/">Xtorrent</a> has also seen some recent activity with the release of Xtorrent 2 in beta. I wonder if we'll ever see any of those amazing new features promised for <a href="http://www.discoapp.com/">Disco</a>.
