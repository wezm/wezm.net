Since buying our own home in January 2010 Amanda and I have had plans to get a dog. Unfortunately the
property we bought only had a fence on two out of the four sides, so we needed to get the backyard
fenced such that it would contain a dog before we could get one. Some many months later the fencing
works have begun and last Sunday we collected an eight week old Border Terrier puppy who we
have named Ruby. So far she's settling in well and getting used to the daily routine.
