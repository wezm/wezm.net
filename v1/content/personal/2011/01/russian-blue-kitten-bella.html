When we decided to get a dog we also decided to get a cat. We did some research
which suggested it was quite possible for a dog and cat to be friends and keep
each other company, particularly if they grew up together. So when we found
[Ruby][ruby], Amanda went on the lookout for Russian Blue kittens. Like Ruby we
did a bit of research beforehand and decided on the Russian Blue breed based on
its temperament.

The search for breeders yielded two candidates. One turned out to be bordering
on a kitten farm. There were lots of cats, all outside. The enclosures were
clean and the cats looked healthy enough but we'd read that it wasn't the type
of environment that would raise a friendly, well adjusted kitten. The other
option turned out much better. The kittens were around 4 weeks old, they were
living inside, regularly handled and there was only the single litter. We
picked out Bella and started the wait for her to be old enough to come home
with us.

That day came yesterday. Bella feels dainty and fragile compared to the
boisterous and rapidly growing Ruby. She is cuddly, playful and friendly. At
first she was a bit nervous but by the end of the day was happily exploring all
areas she could reach, which is most.

We kept Ruby separate at first, introducing them later in the day. Ruby, as she
does with most people and animals just wanted to play with Bella. Bella was not
so happy to see Ruby but seemed to relax around her as the day went on.
Hopefully she continues to adjust and as she grows up becomes as friendly with
Ruby as she is with her.
