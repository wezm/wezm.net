Amongst them was this particular one. Now that I'm not twelve and obsessed by tractors and earth moving equipment it seemed quite bizarre. The caption on the back reads:

> A view of a Karri tree being lifted prior to loading on to a truck at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Pemberton,+WA,+Australia&sll=53.540307,-2.672424&sspn=0.749982,0.906372&g=pemberton&ie=UTF8&ll=-33.888658,116.526489&spn=4.190239,3.625488&z=8&iwloc=addr">Pemberton</a> Western Australia

Pemberton is in the southern part of Western Australia that features the Karri forests. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karri">According to Wikipedia</a> Karri trees can grow up to 90m tall, making them amongst the tallest trees in the world. The photo seems like such a strange image to put on a post card. I can't imagine writing home to family telling them about the beautiful Karri forests on a card that depicts them being destroyed.
