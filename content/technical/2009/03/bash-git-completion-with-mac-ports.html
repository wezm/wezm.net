Git comes with bash completion support which comes in handy for completing branch names and things like that. To get this support when installing git via Mac Ports you must add the bash\_completion variant. You'll also want to install the bash\_completion port. After that you need to add the following to your `~/.bashrc` file:

    if [ -f /opt/local/etc/bash_completion ]; then
        . /opt/local/etc/bash_completion
    fi

For reference I have the following Git related config in my `.bashrc`:
