If you're a Melbourne Linux user interested in getting started with VirtualBox it might be worth checking out the next Melbourne Linux Users Group meeting. They're holding a workshop on installing a guest with seamless mouse and keyboard integration. I assume the integration part means they will cover installing the VirtualBox additions on the guest. See the <a href="http://www.mlug.org.au/">MLUG website</a> for all the details.
