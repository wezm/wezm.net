Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 was released on Valentines day 2009, "after 22 months of constant development", according to <a href="http://debian.org/News/2009/20090214">the announcement</a>. 22 months is still a long time between releases but its certainly an improvement over the nearly three years between 3.0 and 3.1 (sarge) and consistent with the 21 months between 3.1 and 4.0.

As always the upgrade procedure is straightforward and worked seamlessly for me. I followed the <a href="http://www.go2linux.org/upgrading-debian">instructions on go2linux</a>.
