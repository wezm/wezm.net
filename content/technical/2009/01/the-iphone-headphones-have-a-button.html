Before Christmas I was speaking with two colleagues and recent iPhone adopters about headphones. They were examining my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-EX71SLA-Fontopia-Bud-Style-Headphones/dp/B000JKHXPQ/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1231211983&sr=1-3">Sony MDR-EX71s</a> (white, short cable) connected to <a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/smarttalk">Griffin SmartTalk</a>. I mentioned the SmartTalk gives third-party headphones a button and microphone. I was asked if you could answer calls with the button to which I said, "yes, it does all the same things as the included headphones". To which the reply was, "the included ones have a button?". Yep they certainly do.
