A few days ago I decided I wanted a feed of the <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/News">VirtualBox News</a> page. I mainly wanted this to know when new releases are made. Whilst the application does update itself, sometimes I go a while without firing it up so seeing the release in <a href="http://feedafever.com/">Fever</a> would be nice.

After some brief Googling I didn't come across anything that was obviously
designed to create feeds from Ruby (outside of Rails). So I opened up the <a
  href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287">Atom Feed spec</a> and built the
feed manually. Thanks to the brilliant <a
  href="http://nokogiri.rubyforge.org/nokogiri/">nokogiri</a> this was
relatively straightforward.
