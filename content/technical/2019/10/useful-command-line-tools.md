Inspired by [a similar post by Ben Boyter][boyter] this a list of useful
command line tools that I use. It's not a list of every tool I use. These are
tools that are new or typically not part of a standard POSIX command line
environment.

This post is a living document and will be updated over time. It should be
obvious that I have a **strong** preference for fast tools without a large
runtime dependency like Python or node.js. Most of these tools are portable
to \*BSD, Linux, macOS. Many also work on Windows. For OSes that ship up
to date software many are available via the system package repository.

**About my CLI environment:** I use the [zsh] shell, [Pragmata Pro] font, and
[base16 default dark][base16] color scheme. My prompt is generated by
[promptline].

### Alacritty ![Language: Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-rust-%23dea584)

Alacritty is fast terminal emulator. Whilst not strictly a command line tool, it
does host everything I do in the command line. It is the terminal emulator in use
in all the screenshots on this page.

<a name="alt"></a>
### alt ![Language: Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-rust-%23dea584)

`alt` is a tool for finding the alternate to a file. E.g. the header for an
implementation or the test for an implementation. I use it paired with Neovim
to easily toggle between tests and implementation.

    $ alt app/models/page.rb
    spec/models/page_spec.rb

### fd ![Language: Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-rust-%23dea584)

`fd` is an alternative to `find` and has a more user friendly command line interface
and respects ignore files, like `.gitignore`. The combination of its speed and ignore
file support make it excellent for searching for files in git repositories.

<a class="action-button action-button-ghost" href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd">Homepage</a>

<a name="hexyl"></a>

<a name="jq"></a>
### jq ![Language: C](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-C-%23444444)

Alacritty) links are clickable (without the url being visible like in a web
browser) and images are rendered.

<a name="podman"></a>
### Podman ![Language: Go](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-Go-%2300ADD8)

`podman` is an alternative to Docker that does not require a daemon. Containers are run as
the user running Podman so files written into the host don't end up owned by root. The CLI
is largely compatible with the `docker` CLI.

regular expression. It's extremely fast, and respects ignore files and binary
files by default.

`shotgun` is a tool for taking screenshots on X.org based environments.
All the screenshots in this post were taken with it. It pairs well with
`slop`.

<a name="tig"></a>
### tig ![Language: C](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-C-%23444444)

### titlecase ![Language: Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-rust-%23dea584)

`titlecase` is a little tool I wrote to format text using a [title case format
described by John Gruber][df-titlecase]. It correctly handles puctuation, and words like
iPhone. I use it to obtain consistent titles on all my blog posts.

    $ echo 'an illustrated guide to useful command line tools' | titlecase
    An Illustrated Guide to Useful Command Line Tools

I typically use it from within Neovim where selected text is piped through it in-place.
This is done by creating a visual selection and then typing: `:!titlecase`.

navigate to the definition of symbols in files.

<a name="watchexec"></a>
### watchexec ![Language: Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-rust-%23dea584)

`watchexec` is a file and directory watcher that can run commands in response to
file-system changes. Handy for auto running tests or restarting a development
web server when source files change.

    # run command on file change
    $ watchexec -w content cobalt build

    # kill and restart server on file change
    $ watchexec -w src -s SIGINT -r 'cargo run'
