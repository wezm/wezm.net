My trusty Power Mac G5 that was replaced by a Mac Pro earlier this year is now on eBay. If you're in Australia and you or someone you know is looking for a cheap, capable, expandable workstation send them to the auction.

P.S. It pains me to have Flash on my site but its the easiest way to embed the auction. There's no AU version of the "<a href="http://togo.ebay.com/">eBay To Go</a>" feature I used either, which is why its in US dollars.
