I had the need today to read in a list of patterns from a file, expand them and then operate upon each file all from within a shell script. Apparently there is a <a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-0210/6m6nb7mas?a=view">shell built-in for csh</a>, but I didn't want to learn csh at that point. The eventual solution was to run an extra shell with the -c argument.

Example:
    #!/bin/bash
    FILES=`cat patterns.txt`
    for pattern in $FILES; do
        bash -c "ls -l ${pattern}"
    done
