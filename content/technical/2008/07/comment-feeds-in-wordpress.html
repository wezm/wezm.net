Here's tip for something I worked out today. WordPress blogs generally have an RSS feed available for the comments on a post. This is handy for when you want to see other comments posted without having to remember to check back. The problem is many <acronym title="WordPress">WP</acronym> themes don't provide a link to the feed. The solution is to add <code>/feed</code> to the URL of the post, so for this post the comment feed is at:
<a href="http://www.wezm.net/2008/07/02/comment-feeds-in-wordpress/feed">http://www.wezm.net/2008/07/02/comment-feeds-in-wordpress/feed</a>.
