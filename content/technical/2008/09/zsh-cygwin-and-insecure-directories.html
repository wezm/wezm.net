In order to cope with having to use Windows at work I run Cygwin. My shell of choice is zsh. For whatever reason the Cygwin package of zsh installs with a series of directories that the zsh completion system deems to be insecure and it makes sure you know this. Each time a new shell is opened (in my case through a Windows native rxvt terminal) I would receive the following warning:

    Ignore insecure directories and continue [ny]?

Pressing 'y' becomes a bit tedious after a while so I decided to track down these insecure directories and fix them.

<tt>man zshcompsys</tt> reveals the following about the security check:

Running compaudit revealed the following:

    % compaudit 
    There are insecure directories:
    /usr/share/zsh/site-functions
    /usr/share/zsh/4.3.4/functions
    /usr/share/zsh
    /usr/share/zsh/4.3.4

Examining the permissions on these directories showed they were all group writable.

    % ls -ld /usr/share/zsh/site-functions
    drwxrwx---+ 2 wmoore mkgroup-l-d 0 Sep  4 10:54 /usr/share/zsh/site-functions

Stripping them of the group write permission fixed the problem and made starting a new shell a little more pleasant.

    % chmod g-w /usr/share/zsh/site-functions /usr/share/zsh/4.3.4/functions /usr/share/zsh /usr/share/zsh/4.3.4
    % compaudit                                                                 
    % 

**Update:** _kylexlau_ provides this one line solution for correcting to permissions on each of the directories that compaudit returns:

    compaudit | xargs chmod g-w
