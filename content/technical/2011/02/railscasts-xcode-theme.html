I decided it was time to get Xcode matching Vim and TextMate and install a
Railscasts theme. I found two to choose from:

* [Chu Yeow](http://blog.codefront.net/2010/02/04/railscasts-xcode-theme/)
* [10 to 1](http://blog.10to1.be/cocoa/2009/09/25/railscasts-xcode-theme/)

I tried them both out but they felt a bit off, so I cracked open the TextMate
theme and copied the colours across as much as possible. I also took the
liberty of setting the font to [Consolas]. The result feels about right to me.
You can install the theme automatically by running the following in the
Terminal:

    curl -sS https://gist.github.com/raw/835231/install.sh | sh

Or to install manually, [visit the Gist on GitHub][gist] and download the
`xccolortheme` file to `~/Library/Application Support/Xcode/Color Themes`.
