For a [node.js][node] project I'm working on I wanted to generate a [Sphinx
xmlpip2e][xmlpipe] data stream.  The options for generating XML with node.js
seemed a bit limited. The main contender appeared to be [libmljs] but it
segfaulted whenever I tried to use it. A browse of the issue tracker seemed to
suggest the project was quite complex and crashing problems were not uncommon.

[node]: http://nodejs.org/
[xmlpipe]: http://sphinxsearch.com/docs/manual-1.10.html TODO
[libmljs]: https://github.com/polotek/libxmljs

So with previous experience using Tim Bray's Genx library I decieded to write
bindings for node. The result is [node-genx], which is available via [npm].

    npm install genx

[node-genx]: https://github.com/wezm/node-genx
[npm]: http://npmjs.org/

Example Usage
-------------

### xmlpipe2

In this example the first 10 Google search results for "node.js xml" are retrieved
and converted into an xmlpipe2 stream, suitable for indexing with Sphinx.

    

### Atom Feed

In this example, as in the former the first 10 Google search results for "node.js xml"
are retrieved and converted into an Atom feed.
