For a [node.js][node] project I'm working on I wanted to generate a [Sphinx
xmlpipe2][xmlpipe] data stream.  The options for generating XML with node.js
seemed a bit limited. The main contender appeared to be [libmljs] but it
segfaulted whenever I tried to use it. So with previous experience using Tim Bray's [Genx][genx] C library I decided to write
bindings for node. The result is [node-genx], which is available via [npm].

    npm install genx

[node]: http://nodejs.org/
[xmlpipe]: http://sphinxsearch.com/docs/manual-1.10.html#xmlpipe2
[libmljs]: https://github.com/polotek/libxmljs
[node-genx]: https://github.com/wezm/node-genx
[genx]: http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/02/20/GenxStatus
[npm]: http://npmjs.org/

Example Usage
-------------

Provided below are a couple of examples of using the genx module. To run them you will need the following modules, the version
used at the time of writing is noted in brackets. The examples were developed
against node.js v0.2.6.

* jquery (1.4.4)
* jsdom (0.1.20)
* genx (0.8.0)
* node-uuid (1.1.0)

These packages can be installed via npm. Note that jsdom is omitted from the list because
it is a dependency of jquery:

    npm install jquery genx node-uuid

### xmlpipe2

In this example the first 10 Google search results for "node.js xml" are retrieved
and converted into an xmlpipe2 stream, suitable for indexing with Sphinx.

### Atom Feed

In this example, as in the former the first 10 Google search results for "node.js xml"
are retrieved and converted into an Atom feed.
