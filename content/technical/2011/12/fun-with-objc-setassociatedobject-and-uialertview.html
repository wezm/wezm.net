When it comes time to present errors or other messages with UIAlertView
it becomes immediately obvious that a more convienient interface would
involve the use of blocks. A [search on GitHub][github-search] shows
just about every developer has had a crack at it.

[github-search]: TODO

After reviewing the better options (I.e. those that actually had a
README with more than a few lines of content) on GitHub it appeared
that one of the challenges was how to handle memory. This stems from
the wrapper becoming the delegate for the UIAlertView but not having a
strong reference from the caller. I saw various solutions to this, most
involving adding a extra retain call to keep everything around until the
delegate methods were called.

Since my project is using ARC I looked for a solution that
didn't involve marking the wrapper file as non-ARC and
invoking `retain`. The solution I came up with was to use
[`objc_setAssociatedObject`][set-object]. This Objective-C runtime
function allows one object to be associated with another using various
memory management strategies. I used this to associate the UIAlertView
blocks based wrapper with the UIAlertView.

[set-object]: TODO

In the `init` method:

    objc_setAssociatedObject(alertView, _cmd, self, OBJC_ASSOCIATION_RETAIN);

Note that I'm using the implicit second argument to the method, its
selector, `_cmd` as the key for the associated object. This was
suggested in a [tweet by Bill Bummager][bbum].

Then in `alertView:didDismissWithButtonIndex:`, the assocation is
removed, `dealloc` of the wrapper called and the `UIAlertView` also
released.

    SEL key = @selector(initWithTitle:message:);
    objc_setAssociatedObject(self.alertView, key, nil, OBJC_ASSOCIATION_RETAIN);
