A couple of weeks ago I gave an introduction to Rust talk at our tech all
hands meeting. The talk was a quick 30 minute introduction to the language that
covered:

* Where the project came from, where it fits, and what it's trying to solve.
* Some of the main features and tools.
* Some core concepts.
* Live coding a little demo program.
