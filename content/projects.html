I have collection of source code on [GitHub][github]. Some of the more noteworthy
projects are listed below.

Monothumb
---------

`monothumb` is the tool that generates the thumbnails on the [home page](/). It
retrieves thumbnails of my [recent uploads to Flickr][flickr], converts them to
greyscale and then generates a single output image with both the colour and
monochrome version of the thumbnail. There are two version of the tool. The
original one, written in Objective-C that uses CoreImage and a second version
written in Lua. The Lua one is the one currently in use.

Weather Station
---------------

I have a weather station at my home for keeping track of the local conditions.
I added support for [SQLite][sqlite] logging to [my fork][open2300fork] of the
[Open2300][open2300] project. The weather station is connected to our TV
computer, which is a Mac mini. Periodically it logs the current conditions,
uploads them to my server and invokes a [lua program][weather-tools] to generate
a [JSON][json] file, which is used on the [Weather page][weather].
