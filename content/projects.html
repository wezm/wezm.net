Monothumb
---------

`monothumb` is the tool that generates the thumbnails on the [home page](/). It
retrieves thumbnails of my [recent uploads to Flickr][flickr], converts them to
greyscale and then generates a single output image with both the colour and
monochrome version of the thumbnail. There are two version of the tool. The
original one, written in Objective-C that uses CoreImage and a second version
written in Lua. The Lua one is the one currently in use.
