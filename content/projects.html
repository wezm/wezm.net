Binary Trance Software
----------------------

Through my app development company [Binary Trance Software][bt] I've
built the following apps:

* [SymbolMate][symbolmate] -- Quickly find and copy symbols and Emoji

[symbolmate]: https://binarytrance.com/apps/symbolmate

Websites
--------

A couple of other websites I maintain are:

* [Read Rust][readrust] -- an aggregator of news about the [Rust programming
  language][Rust].
* [Bit Cannon][bitcannon] -- a new blog that I designed and built with
  [Hugo][hugo] as a bit of an experiment, the exact nature of which is still
  evolving.
* [Linked List][linkedlist] -- "a semi-organized collection of knowledge
  that I have accumulated.", created as a reference for myself but also published
  publically in the hope it may be useful to others as well. The code ([pkb])
  is open source.

to make managing the content easier.

### OCMustache

[OCMustache][ocmustache] brings the [Mustache templating language][mustache] to
Objective-C. The parser is built using the [Ragel State Machine
Compiler][ragel] in the hope that it will help ensure fast and correct parsing.

### Monothumb

[monothumb] is the tool that generates the thumbnails on the [home page](/). It
retrieves thumbnails of my [recent uploads to Flickr][flickr], converts them to
greyscale and then generates a single output image with both the colour and
monochrome versions of the thumbnail. There are two version of the tool. The
original one, written in Objective-C that uses CoreImage and a second version
written in Lua. The Lua one uses my [lua-imlib2] fork.

### node-genx

[node-genx] is a [node.js][node] binding to the [Genx][genx] XML generation
library.  It allows fast and correct XML generation from the Javascript based
node.js environment.  Available for easy install via [npm].

### Weather Station

I previously had a weather station at my home for keeping track of the local
conditions.  I added support for [SQLite][sqlite] logging to [my
fork][open2300fork] of the [Open2300][open2300] project. The weather station
was connected to a Mac for data logging.  Every 5 minutes it logged the current
conditions, uploaded them to my server and invoked a [lua
program][weather-tools] to generate a [JSON][json] file, which was used to
produce the [Weather page][weather].
