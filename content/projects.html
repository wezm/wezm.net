Monothumb
---------

`monothumb` is the tool that generates the thumbnails on the [home page](/). It retrieves thumbnails of my recent uploads to Flickr, converts them to greyscale and then generates a single output image with both the colour and monochrome version of the thumbnail. Additionally it writes out an edited version of the XML retrieved from the FLickr API that some Javascript uses to present the thumbnails on the page.
