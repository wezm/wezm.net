### OCMustache

[OCMustache][ocmustache] brings the [Mustache templating language][mustache] to
Objective-C. The parser is built using the [Ragel State Machine
Compiler][ragel] in the hope that it will help ensure fast and correct parsing.

### Monothumb

[monothumb] is the tool that generates the thumbnails on the [home page](/). It
retrieves thumbnails of my [recent uploads to Flickr][flickr], converts them to
greyscale and then generates a single output image with both the colour and
monochrome versions of the thumbnail. There are two version of the tool. The
original one, written in Objective-C that uses CoreImage and a second version
written in Lua. The Lua one uses my [lua-imlib2] fork.

### Weather Station

I previously had a weather station at my home for keeping track of the local
conditions.  I added support for [SQLite][sqlite] logging to [my
fork][open2300fork] of the [Open2300][open2300] project. The weather station
was connected to a Mac for data logging.  Every 5 minutes it logged the current
conditions, uploaded them to my server and invoked a [lua
program][weather-tools] to generate a [JSON][json] file, which was used to
produce the [Weather page][weather].
