Binary Trance Software
----------------------

Through my app development company [Binary Trance Software][bt] I've
built the following apps:

* [SymbolMate][symbolmate] -- Quickly find and copy symbols and Emoji

[symbolmate]: https://binarytrance.com/apps/symbolmate

Websites
--------

A couple of other websites I maintain are:

* [Read Rust][readrust] -- an aggregator of news about the [Rust programming
  language][Rust].
* [Bit Cannon][bitcannon] -- a new blog that I designed and built with
  [Hugo][hugo] as a bit of an experiment, the exact nature of which is still
  evolving.
* [Linked List][linkedlist] -- "a semi-organized collection of knowledge
  that I have accumulated.", created as a reference for myself but also published
  publically in the hope it may be useful to others as well. The code ([pkb])
  is open source.

BSD CI
------

[BSD CI] (currently in development) aims to provide a simple way for software
projects to build and test on [BSD operating systems][run-bsd].

Open Source Projects
--------------------

I have a collection of open-source software on [GitHub][github]. Some of the
more noteworthy projects are listed below.

### Read Rust

[Read Rust][readrust-git] is an aggregator of news related to the Rust programming language.
It is built with the [Cobalt] static site compiler along with some tools built
to make managing the content easier.

### pkb

[pkb] is a personal knowledge base. It's a [Rails] application that allows you
to quickly publish snippets of knowledge. It powers
[linkedlist.org][linkedlist], which is my instance of pkb.

[Rails]: http://rubyonrails.org/
[linkedlist]: https://linkedlist.org/

### titlecase

[titlecase] is a command line tool and Rust crate that capitalizes English text
according to [a style defined by John Gruber][titlecase-style] for post titles
on his website [Daring Fireball]. titlecase runs on Linux, macOS, FreeBSD,
NetBSD, and Windows.

### OCMustache

[OCMustache][ocmustache] brings the [Mustache templating language][mustache] to
Objective-C. The parser is built using the [Ragel State Machine
Compiler][ragel] in the hope that it will help ensure fast and correct parsing.

[ragel]: http://www.complang.org/ragel/

### node-genx

[node-genx] is a [node.js][node] binding to the [Genx][genx] XML generation
library.  It allows fast and correct XML generation from the Javascript based
node.js environment.  Available for easy install via [npm].

[genx]: http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/02/20/GenxStatus
[npm]: http://npmjs.org/

### Weather Station

I previously had a weather station at my home for keeping track of the local
conditions.  I added support for [SQLite][sqlite] logging to [my
fork][open2300fork] of the [Open2300][open2300] project. The weather station
was connected to a Mac for data logging.  Every 5 minutes it logged the current
conditions, uploaded them to my server and invoked a [lua
program][weather-tools] to generate a [JSON][json] file, which was used to
produce the [Weather page][weather].

[sqlite]: http://www.sqlite.org/
[open2300]: http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Open2300/WebHome
[open2300fork]: http://github.com/wezm/open2300
[weather]: /weather/
[json]: http://www.json.org/
[weather-tools]: http://github.com/wezm/weather-tools

See the following posts for more information on the weather station:
