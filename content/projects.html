I have a collection of open-source software on [GitHub][github]. Some of the
more noteworthy projects are listed below.

Monothumb
---------

[monothumb] is the tool that generates the thumbnails on the [home page](/). It
retrieves thumbnails of my [recent uploads to Flickr][flickr], converts them to
greyscale and then generates a single output image with both the colour and
monochrome versions of the thumbnail. There are two version of the tool. The
original one, written in Objective-C that uses CoreImage and a second version
written in Lua. The Lua one uses my [lua-imlib](#lua-imlib) fork.

[OCMustache][ocmustache] brings the [Mustache templating language][mustache] to
Objective-C. The parser is built using the [Ragel State Machine

Weather Station
---------------

I have a weather station at my home for keeping track of the local conditions.
I added support for [SQLite][sqlite] logging to [my fork][open2300fork] of the
[Open2300][open2300] project. The weather station is connected to my Mac.
Every 5 minutes it logs the current conditions, uploads them to my server and
invokes a [lua program][weather-tools] to generate a [JSON][json] file,
which is used to produce the [Weather page][weather].
