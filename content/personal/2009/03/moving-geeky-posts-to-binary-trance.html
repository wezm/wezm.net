I read a post by <a href="http://www.useit.com/jakob/">Jakob Nielsen</a> today titled, <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/weblogs.html">Weblog Usability: The Top Ten Design Mistakes</a>. It was written back in 2005 but is still very relevant to today. The eighth point, "Mixing Topics", which states, "If you publish on many different topics, you're less likely to attract a loyal audience of high-value users" seemed particularly relevant given the diversity of topics in my recent posts. As a result I've decided to stop posting geeky content on this site and instead post that to my somewhat neglected software site, <a href="http://www.binarytrance.com/">Binary Trance</a> (which needs a redesign). So if there if there is anyone out there that wants drop the personal stuff or keep getting the geeky stuff I suggest you check it out. If you're just after the feed I can save you the trip: <a href="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/BinaryTranceBlog">Feed for Binary Trance Blog</a>.

**Update:** I have completely redesigned WezM.net and consolidated the geeky content with the non-geeky content. The design attempts to provide a useful split if you're only interested one of them.
