I thought I'd try it out so I sent them an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_reply_coupon">International Reply Coupon</a> (IRC) (something I'd never heard of before) and what do you know they showed up today. They managed to come all the way from San Francisco in an unsealed envelope too. Now to decide what to stick them to... and who to give the unicorn one to.
