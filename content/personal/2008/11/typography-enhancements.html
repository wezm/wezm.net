Added a couple of WordPress plugins tonight to make the text on this blog a little prettier and hopefully more readable. First up is <a href="http://kingdesk.com/projects/wp-hyphenate/">wp-hyphenate</a> by <a href="http://kingdesk.com/">KINGdesk</a> to apply hyphenation rules. Second is <a href="http://blog.hamstu.com/2007/05/31/web-typography-just-got-better/">wp-typogrify</a>, which applies <a href="http://michelf.com/projects/php-smartypants/">PHP SmartyPants</a> (originally by <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/">John Gruber</a>) to make "curly quotes" and proper dashes.

<strong>Update:</strong> I disabled wp-hyphenate as it was doing strange things to my html. In one case it was changing

<code>&lt;table class="top_headers"&gt;</code> into

<code>&lt;table 
lass="top_headers"&gt;</code>
