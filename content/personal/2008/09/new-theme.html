After a lot of scouring the net I finally stumbled upon a theme I liked at <a href="http://themeforest.net/?ref=wezm">ThemeForest</a> (affiliate link) today. Clearly I still have to customise the header image. I also installed the <a href="http://www.bravenewcode.com/wptouch/">WPtouch</a> plugin, which presents a version of the site optimised for iPhone and iPod touch when viewed on these devices.

<strong>Update:</strong> My friend Sandra helped me out with fixing the logo. I think it looks great.
