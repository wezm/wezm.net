Being a professional programmer I spend plenty of time in front of a 
keyboard. Unfortunately I never learned to touch type. Instead I developed my
own style of typing that uses all my fingers but requires me to look at the 
keyboard. I've made a couple of attempts over the years to break this habit
but always reverted to my old ways, primarily due to the large speed difference.

The topic came up during our Monday meeting today and it renewed my desire to break
the habit. I've decided that committing publicly may help motivate me.

As the first step in this process I've painstakingly typed this whole post
without looking at my hands. It's taken a long time, let's hope that improves
quickly.
