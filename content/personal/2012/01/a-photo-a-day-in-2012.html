This year I've decided to have a go at publishing a photo every day
of the year. I'm not the first to do this, its also known by the name
[Project 365][project365]. I'm publishing my photos to the [2012 set on
Flickr][set]. The first week whilst I was still on Christmas holidays was
pretty easy. Although I am missing a photo for Jan 2 as the photo I took
got deleted whilst trying to restore my iPhone that got drowned in a river.
Anyway after returning to work its been harder to find things to take 
pictures of but I haven't missed a day yet.
