As a winter escape we went to Fiji for 10 days in August. We spent 3 nights on
Nanuya Balavu Island at the [Mantaray Island Resort]. We had hoped to swim with
Manta rays here but they did not show up for us. We also spent 4 night on
Nanuya Lailai Island at the [Nanuya Island Resort]. This was a lovely few days
especially because the sun found us. During our stay we went snorkelling,
kayaking, caving and did a walk to a tea house in the village on the island.
All in all it was the perfect, warm, relaxing holiday. Definitely recommended.
