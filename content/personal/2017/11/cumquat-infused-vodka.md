Some 9 years after my [first attempt](/personal/2008/11/cumquat-liqueur/) at
making Cumquat liqueur my little Cumquat tree was loaded with fruit again. 

The
tree is living at my parents house after I moved into an apartment and no
longer had space for it and Mum asked what to do with the fruit. The
orginal liqueur turned out fine but wasn't really to my taste so my suggestion
was to try making Cumquat infused vodka.
