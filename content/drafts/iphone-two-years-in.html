Two years ago I wrote, "[iPhone 3G One Week In](/personal/2008/07/iphone-3g-one-week-in/)".
In that time I replaced the iPhone 3G with a 3GS, copy-paste and multitasking have been
added to the newly renamed iOS, iPhone 4 has recently been released and Android
has risen to be viable competitor to iPhone --- a lot has happened.

In the original post I reviewed things like typing on the onscreen keyboard and the
web browser. Nowadays these things barely enter into a review of a smartphone. They're
common and expected to work well.
